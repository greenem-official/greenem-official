Hi, my name's Ivan and I'm 19.  
Most of the time I use and learn Java  
I've already done a bunch of Minecraft plugins for myself, I think I'm gonna release most of them here at some point.  
Also I'm trying to learn Unity  
Resently started learning making minecraft mods, it's a completely different thing  
That's all
