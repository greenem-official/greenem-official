Hi, my name's Ivan and I'm 21 (as of 05/2025).  
Most of the time I use and learn Java  
Additionally I have some C++ and Python knowledge (C++ is on a different account)

Usually I make Discord bots with JDA (Java Discord API), learn Spring Framework and things like JavaFX  
In the past I've spent a lot of time developing a bunch of Minecraft plugins for myself, some may be released at some point, and one is published already.  
Also I'm trying to learn Unity
